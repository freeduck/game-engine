So this is a library that's (if we can get it to be) separate from any particular rendering
system -- e.g. mode-lambda.  It's like animated-sprite in v1.  It manages the current frame
of an animation, whether it is paused, its speed (unless we can lift that to a meta-component),
etc. [what else?] 

But one tweak we'll make on the old animated-sprite, is that we'll keep better track of 
sprites.  We won't duplicate them unnecessarily or let them get passed around in the game state.
We'll manage that memory separately.
