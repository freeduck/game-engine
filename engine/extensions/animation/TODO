;TODO: Write tests for speed (figure out how to make implementation dependent)

;TODO: Physics

;TODO: User input needs to get handled at the lux level.  Do we try to separate it from the renderer?

;TODO:
;Another optimization, medium trickiness level:
;  entity components and game entities should be vectors, not lists when mutable-state is on  
;  (Need to Experiment, though: Would make updates faster, but adds and removals slower, maybe...)
